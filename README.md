Hi 👋 My name is Trey Rader
==============================

Full Stack Web Developer
------------------------

* 🌍  I'm based in New Orleans, Louisiana
* 🖥️  See my portfolio at [Trey Rader](http://treyrader.com/)
* ✉️  You can contact me at [treyrdr09@gmai.com](mailto:treyrdr09@gmai.com)
* 🧠  I'm currently learning React Figma UX/UI Design
* 🤝  Would love to collaborate!

My coding journey began by teaching myself the fundamentals of web devlopment back in 2016. Within months thereafter, I decided it best to level up by enrolling into a remote coding bootcamp located in NYC, called Thinkful. Eagar to get my hands on some real world experience and coupled with funds being scarce, however, I deiced to resign from the program pre-maturely which coincided in me landing my first professional coding job, a startup called Today's One-room Schoolhouse (TORSH) whose mission is to to innovate educational technology, a mission that aligned perfectly with my own. I worked with Torsh for two years. 

The years to follow have consisted of me doing little freelance projects for local musicians in New Orleans as well as performing and studying piano styles associated with the region, a place I call home. In late 2022, however, I decided to lay my piano endeavors to rest for a bit so to focus all my attention of leveling up my coding skills by learning new web technologies and latest trends in the industry. All this was catalyzed by my desire to achieve a less precarious living situation and as well as begin building my own Saas company, called Vouzot.

Similar to TORSH, Vouzot's mission is to help make gains towards education, but particularly within the realm of culture and music. I foresee the platform being a place for lousiana cajuns and creoles to express authentic presentations of personal histories and folklores, sacred recipes in unique louisiana cuisine, to shine light on the myriad of francophone venaculars resonating throughout the entire reigion of South Louisiana, and, most importantly, to capture with purity the rich musical heritages born only in Louisiana, my home state. 

Although Vouzot has been the subject of my attention since 2022, I am always open for tech opportunites and am free to collaborate with likeminded devs, scholars, and cultural preservationists. If you'd like to learn more, don't hesitate to checkout my website where I have a section for showcasing all of my latest projects (See links below).

Nice meeting you!
